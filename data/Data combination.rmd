The code chunk appears:
```{r}
Sys.setlocale(category = 'LC_CTYPE', locale = 'C')
setwd("C:\\Users\\10648\\OneDrive\\22_Fall\\STOR_520\\Final_Project\\Data")
pop = read.csv("world_population.csv")
GDP = read.csv("GDP_Data.csv")
Grwoth = read.csv("GDP Growth Rate.csv")
library(dplyr)
```

Type any R code in the chunk, for example:
```{r}
small_gdp = GDP[GDP$Country.Code %in% pop$CCA3,]
growth = Grwoth[Grwoth$Country.Code %in% pop$CCA3,]


pop$Country.Code = pop$CCA3
joined = full_join(small_gdp, pop, by = "Country.Code")
joined = full_join(joined, growth, by = "Country.Code")

joined = joined %>% select(- "CCA3")

write.csv(joined,"C:\\Users\\10648\\OneDrive\\22_Fall\\STOR_520\\Final_Project\\Data\\File Name.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```
